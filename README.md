# iga_scripts
This is a collection of IDA (V7) Python scripts, which hope to make IDAPython much more user-friendly and enjoyable :D.

## Features
This is just an overview, please check the documentations below for the full set of features.
- `memory`
	- `Pointer`
		- RW `bytes, int, pointer, string`
		- Hex dump
		- Arithmetics ( + - == )
- `struc`
	- Types (the type defs, not instances)
		- `StrucT`
			- Find by name
			- Get `id, name, members, size`
			- Subscript access for member `MemberT`
			- Get `StrucI` instance from `Pointer`
		- `MemberT`
			- Get `id, name, type, offset, size`
	- Instance (instances with memory addresses)
		- `StrucI`
			- Get `members`
			- Subscript access for member value
- `module`
	- `Module`
		- Enumerate all modules
		- Find module by name
- `misc`
	- Find local variable in function frame (not working rn.)
	- Find global symbol by name
- All classes are pretty-printed when evaluated!

### WIP
- Modifying structs, automatically managing members and adjusting offsets.
- More automation?
